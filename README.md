# Whole House Water Monitoring
This is a tutorial on how to monitor whole-house water usage using ESPHome integrated with Home Assistant. This assumes you already have ESPHome and Home Assistant setup.

Some example use cases would be to: 
* Calculate your current running water bill
* Get notified, or automatically shutoff water (extra hardware needed) if water is running when everyone is asleep or when no one is home
* Get notified if water has been continuously running for X number of minutes
* Get notified if a high flow rate is detected - e.g. a sprinkler head broke off and water is pouring out into the street
